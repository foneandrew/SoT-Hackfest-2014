Using trade me API for relocation advice

Project for the Summer of Tech 2014 Hackfest!

We had two days to work on a project that used a New Zealand API to visualise some data.

We used the TradeMe API to visualise available jobs of a certain category, and then available housing of a selected region could be viewed to help users with making decisions about relocting for their careers.

The version in the 'Julies Version' folder is the version which we presented to the judges. Some features were simulated for the sake of the pitch.
A merge error caused a few lines to disapear that makes the map update once a new job is selected which we did not have time to fix. There are a few bugs to do with the CSS as well (one-way radio buttons etc).

My work was to do with the HTML and CSS side of things. I worked primarily on the HTML controls, and had to learn javascript, jquery, and JSON in order to get them to work. My biggest triumph was getting the dropboxes to populate from the trademe API. It was an intense few days, though in terms of what I learnt, I went from knowing zero javascript, to knowing enough to do this project. Extremely stressful but extremely rewarding. I am extremely proud of what I managed to accomplish given what I was up against.

While this isnt the best demonstration of the quality of work I can do, it does show that I can jump out of my comfort zone and still learn and work with the team on a project despite the massive pressure of Hackfest.

Julies Version folder holds the copy we presented as Hackfest, with the added bonus of refreshing properly now.

Big thanks to Hamish from HashBang for helping me out with the javascript!
